\section{Polynomial Affine Gravity}
\label{sec:PAG}

In the following subsections, I present a brief introduction
to the polynomial affine model of gravity, how to build the
ansatz compatible with the spherical symmetry and the field 
equations.

\subsection{Model review}
\label{subsec: model_review}

The Polynomial Affine Gravity uses the affine connection to mediated 
gravitational interactions, instead of the metric tensor. To build 
the action, we decompose the affine connection into its irreducible
fields
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \label{affine_connection}
    \hat{\Gamma}_{\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} & = \hat{\Gamma}_{(\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma)} +  \hat{\Gamma}_{[\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma]},  \\
    & = \ctG{\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma} + \B{\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma} + \delta^{\beta}_{[\gamma}\A{\alpha]},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the first term $\Gamma$ stands for the symmetric part and 
$\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{B}$ fields are related to the skew symmetric
part of the affine connection. 

Additionally, is necessary to introduce a volume form without
the use of the metric tensor. In order to achieve this, we used
the volume element defined as $\mathrm{d}V^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} 
= \mathrm{d}x^\alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}x^\beta \wedge \mathrm{d}x^\gamma
\wedge \mathrm{d}x^\delta$, which is completely antisymmetric.

Moreover, we want to preserve the invariance under diffeomorphism, 
which is why the symmetric part of the affine connection, goes 
indirectly through the covariant derivative $\nabla^\Gamma$. 

The action is built up using a sort of \textit{dimensional analysis}
technique. This strategy allows us to generate every scalar density
composed by powers of the irreducible fields of the affine connection.
This method has been using to build the action in four dimensions, see
Refs. and in three dimensions Ref [].

The most general action (up to topological invariants and boundary terms) 
in four dimensions is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{PAG_action}
    \begin{split}
    S
    & =
    \int  \mathrm{d}V^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} \bigg[
    B_1 \mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\rho}\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\nu}{}_{\beta}\mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\rho}{}_{\delta}
    + B_2 \mathcal{R}_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\mu}{}_{\rho} \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\nu}{}_{\delta} \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\rho}{}_{\nu}
    + B_3 \mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\alpha} \mathcal{B}_{\beta}{}^{\nu}{}_{\gamma} \mathcal{A}_\delta
    \\
    & \quad
    + B_4 \mathcal{R}_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\rho}\mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\rho}{}_{\delta}\mathcal{A}_\sigma
    + B_5 \mathcal{R}_{\alpha \beta}{}^{\rho}{}_{\rho} \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\delta} \mathcal{A}_\sigma
    + C_1 \mathcal{R}_{\mu\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\nu} \nabla_\beta \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\nu}{}_{\delta}
    \\
    & \quad
    + C_2 \mathcal{R}_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\rho}{}_{\rho} \nabla_\sigma \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\delta}
    + D_1 \mathcal{B}_{\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\lambda} \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\nu}{}_{\alpha} \nabla_\beta \mathcal{R}_{\gamma}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\delta}
    + D_2 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\beta} \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\nu} \nabla_{\lambda} \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\nu}{}_{\delta}
    \\
    & \quad
    + D_3 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\nu}\mathcal{B}_{\beta}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\gamma} \nabla_\lambda \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\nu}{}_{\delta}
    + D_4 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\beta}\mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\delta}\nabla_\lambda \mathcal{A}_\sigma
    + D_5 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\beta} \mathcal{A}_\sigma \nabla_\lambda \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\delta}
    \\
    &\quad
    + D_6 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\beta}\mathcal{A}_\gamma \nabla_\lambda A_\delta
    + D_7\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\beta} \mathcal{A}_\lambda \nabla_\gamma A_\delta
    + E_1\nabla_\rho \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\rho}{}_{\beta} \nabla_\sigma \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\delta}
    \\
    &\quad
    + E_2 \nabla_\rho \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\rho}{}_{\beta} \nabla_\gamma \mathcal{A}_\delta
    + F_1 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\beta} \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\sigma}{}_{\delta} \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\rho} \mathcal{B}_{\sigma}{}^{\rho}{}_{\lambda}
    + F_2\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\beta} \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\nu}{}_{\lambda} \mathcal{B}_{\delta}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\rho} \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\rho}{}_{\nu}
    \\
    &\quad
    + F_3 \mathcal{B}_{\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\lambda} \mathcal{B}_{\mu}{}^{\nu}{}_{\alpha} \mathcal{B}_{\beta}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\gamma} \mathcal{A}_\delta
    + F_4 \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\beta}\mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\nu}{}_{\delta}\mathcal{A}_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu \bigg].
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Notice the Riemann curvature and the Ricci tensor are defined with respect to the symmetric part
of the connection.

The action written in Eq. \eqref{PAG_action} is purely affine and does not required the 
existence of a metric tensor to be defined. Additionally is polynomial in the connection
and its covariant derivative, unlike the Einstein-Hilbert action, where there is 
the factor $\sqrt{-g}$.

As a consequence of the lack of metric tensor in our model, the numbers of terms that can
go to the action, is limited due to the geometrical constraint coming from its formulation. 
We call this property, the \textit{rigidity} of the model. 

Moreover, is possible to coupled a scalar field using the \textit{dimensional analysis}
technique. This provide a non-standard procedure to coupled the \textit{kinetic term}
of the scalar field to the irreducible fields coming from the antisymmetric part
of the affine connection and the volume form, without the use of a metric tensor. 
The effects of a scalar field in polynomial affine gravity has been studied in the
torsion-free sector in Ref.[].

Interestingly, all coupling constant are dimensionless, which suggest some sort of
conformal symmetry, at least at a classical level, and also indicates that the
model is power-counting renormalizable. This, is a necessary condition but not
sufficient condition to guarantee that the model is renormalizable.

Finally, in the torsion-free limit it is possible to recover all Einstein vacuum solutions,
meaning that it is a subspace of solutions of of polynomial affine gravity.

\subsection{Building the ansatz}

To build up the ansatz of the affine connection $\Gamma$, we compute its Lie derivative 
$\mathcal{L}_{\xi_j}\ctG{\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma}$ along the Killing vectors $\xi_j$ that 
generate the desired symmetry, in this case a spherical symmetry. The Lie derivative
of a a connection is written as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\xi_i}\ctG{\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma} = \xi_i^\delta\partial_\delta \ctG{\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma}
    -\ctG{\alpha}{\delta}{\beta}\partial_\delta\xi^\beta + \ctG{\alpha}{\beta}{\delta}\partial_\gamma \xi^\delta
    + \ctG{\delta}{\beta}{\gamma}\partial_\alpha \xi^\delta + \frac{\partial^2 \xi ^\beta}{\partial x^\alpha \partial x^\gamma},
\end{equation}
notice this is the standard definition of a Lie derivative of a tensor $(1,2)$, however, 
there is an extra term (non-homogeneous), because the affine connection does not transform
as a tensor. The Killing vectors are
\begin{align}
    \xi_1 & = \sigma\left(0, \cos\phi\sin\theta, \frac{\cos\phi\cos\theta}{r}, -\frac{\sin\phi}{r\sin\theta}\right),\\
    \xi_2 & = \sigma\left(0, \sin\phi\sin\theta, \frac{\sin\phi\cos\theta}{r}, \frac{\cos\phi}{r\sin\theta}\right),\\
    \xi_3 & = \sigma\left(0 , \cos\theta, -\frac{\sin\theta}{r}, 0\right),
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \sqrt{1 - \kappa r^2}.
\end{equation}
This procedure has been cover in Refs. [], and, an explicit computation
of every term can be found in Ref.[]

The affine connection is completely defined by twelve function\footnote{This is valid
in the affine geometry without torsion. If we introduce a non trivial torsion field,
the affine connection is defined by twenty time and radial dependent functions.}, where
each function has a time and radial dependence as follow
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \ctG{t}{t}{t} & = V(t,r) & \ctG{t}{r}{t} & = B(t,r) & \ctG{t}{\theta}{\theta} & = Z(t,r) & \ctG{t}{\phi}{\theta} & = \frac{D(t,r)}{\sin\theta} \\
    \ctG{t}{t}{r} & = A(t,r) & \ctG{t}{r}{r} & = Y(t,r) & \ctG{t}{\theta}{\phi} & = -D(t,r)\sin\theta & \ctG{t}{\phi}{\phi} & = Z(t,r) \\
    \ctG{r}{t}{r} & = W(t,r) & \ctG{r}{r}{r} & = C(t,r) & \ctG{r}{\theta}{\theta} & = G(t,r) & \ctG{r}{\phi}{\theta} & = \frac{H(t,r)}{\sin\theta} \\
    \ctG{\theta}{t}{\theta} & = X(t,r) & \ctG{\theta}{r}{\theta} & = F(t,r) & \ctG{r}{\theta}{\phi} & = -H(t,r)\sin\theta & \ctG{r}{\phi}{\phi} & = G(t,r) \\
    \ctG{\phi}{t}{\phi} & = X(t,r)\sin^2\theta & \ctG{\phi}{r}{\phi} & = F(t,r)\sin^2\theta & \ctG{\phi}{\theta}{\phi} & = -\cos\theta\sin\theta & \ctG{\theta}{\phi}{\phi} & = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin \theta}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Notice that, under a parametrization of the time coordinate, the first coefficient
can be set equal to zero. This transformation has been extensively use in the 
frame of cosmology and can also be applied to the spherical case. For more 
information on this type of transformation, refer to Ref.\cite{Jose_EPJC_2022}.

The above ansatz can be simplified even further 
by imposing additional symmetries on the affine connection. First, lets consider 
stationary solutions
\begin{equation}
    \nabla_{t}e_t = e_t\ctG{t}{t}{t} + e_r\ctG{t}{r}{t}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \nabla_{-t}\left(-e_t\right) = -e_t\ctG{t}{t}{t} + e_r\ctG{t}{r}{t}
\end{equation}
the consistent condition requires that $\ctG{t}{t}{t} = 0$. Applying the same principle
to the other basis vectors, then
\begin{align}
    \ctG{t}{j}{i} & = 0 & \ctG{i}{t}{j} & = 0
\end{align}
where $i$, $j$ are restricted to space index.

Next, we demand an azimuthal angle symmetry, in which case the
\begin{align}
    \ctG{\phi}{\phi}{\phi} & = 0 & \ctG{t}{j}{\phi} & = 0 & \ctG{i}{\phi}{j} & = 0
\end{align}

Notice that the trace of the Riemann tensor does not vanish, meaning that the 
connection is not an \textit{equi-affine} connection. In order to ensure this
condition the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor must vanish
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + 2\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} = 0,
\end{equation}
from which, we can solve for $A\left(t,r\right)$ as
\begin{equation}
    A\left(t,r\right) = a(r) - C(t,r) - 2G(t,r)
\end{equation}


\subsection{Field equations}

In the torsion-free limit, the only non trivial contribution are
coming from the terms that are liner in the irreducible fields of 
the torsion tensor $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$. In this case,
the effective action is written as
\begin{equation}
    \label{PAG_action}
    \begin{split}
    S = \int  \mathrm{d}V^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} \bigg[
    C_1 \mathcal{R}_{\mu\alpha}{}^{\mu}{}_{\nu} \nabla_\beta \mathcal{B}_{\gamma}{}^{\nu}{}_{\delta}\bigg],
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
whose variation with respect to the $\mathcal{B}$ leads
to the field equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{feq}
    \nabla_{[\sigma}\mathcal{R}_{\mu]\nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
where the is said that the Ricci tensor is a Codazzi tensor. From
the field equation written in Eq. \eqref{feq} we distinguish three
branches of solutions: the first type of solutions requires the
Ricci tensor to vanish, meaning $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu} = 0$; the 
second type of solution is the subspace of parallel Ricci; which
implies that $\nabla_{\sigma}\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu} = 0$; the third
type is to solve directly the Codazzi tensor.


\section{Solutions}
\label{sec:solutions}

\section{Analysis of the solutions}

Even though the manifold is only endowed with an affine connection as its 
fundamental field, is possible to still obtain descendent metric structures, the
first comes from its symmetric part, which is the Ricci tensor $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}$,
coming from the natural contraction of the Riemann curvature
\begin{equation}
    \label{ricci}
    \mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\left(\Gamma\right) = \mathcal{R}_{\mu\rho}{}^{\rho}{}_{\nu}\left(\Gamma\right),
\end{equation}
whereas, the second comes from the antisymmetric part of the connection, specifically,
from the contraction of two torsion tensors, defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{poplawski}
    \mathcal{P}_{\mu\nu} = \left(\B{\alpha}{\beta}{\mu} + \delta^\beta_{[\alpha]\A{\mu}}\right)
    \left(\B{\beta}{\alpha}{\nu} + \delta^\alpha_{[\beta]\A{\nu}}\right).
\end{equation}
Therefore, we can use Eq. \eqref{ricci} or Eq. \eqref{poplawski} to define the notion of 
distance, and allowing a classification of vectors into time-lie, space-lie or null-like.\footnote{
This is only valid when the tensors are well behaved, meaning that, they can not be degenerate,
they must be invertible.}
