Spherical static solutions to Polynomial Affine Gravity in the torsion free sector

The polynomial affine gravity it is an alternative gravitational model, whose fundamental field is the affine connection instead of the metric tensor. On this project, we explore the space of solutions to the field equation in the torsion-free sector for an spherical symmetry for the symmetric part of the affine connection.
